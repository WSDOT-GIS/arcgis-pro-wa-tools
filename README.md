# ArcGIS Pro tools for Washington State

## Where to download

The compiled add-in can be found here: [Latest release](https://github.com/WSDOT-GIS/arcgis-pro-wa-tools/releases/latest). The add-in file ends with `.esriAddinX`.

## Tools

### Set map extents to WA

Loops through all maps in a project and sets their extents to [that of WA][Extent of WA]. This makes it so that when you click the zoom to full extent button, the map will zoom to WA rather than the default whole world extent.

[Extent of WA]:https://epsg.io/1416-area
